## How to create conda env

Declare any dependencies in `conda.yml`. To create a conda env based on the requirements file run:

```
conda env create -f conda.yaml
```

If you make any changes to the conda.yaml file you can run `conda env update -f conda.yaml` to update the environment with the latest changes.
